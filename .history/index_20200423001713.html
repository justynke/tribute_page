    <p>
        <b>Krzysztof Eugeniusz Penderecki</b> (Polish: [ˈkʂɨʂtɔf pɛndɛˈrɛt͡skʲi]; 23 November 1933 – 29 March 2020) was a Polish composer and conductor. Among his best known works are Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima, Symphony No. 3, his St. Luke Passion, Polish Requiem, Anaklasis and Utrenja. Penderecki composed:
        <ul>
            <li>four operas</li>
            <li>eight symphonies and other orchestral pieces</li>
            <li>a variety of instrumental concertos</li>
            <li>choral settings of mainly religious texts</li>
            <li>chamber and instrumental works.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Education and first works</h2>
    <p>Penderecki studied music at Jagiellonian University and the Academy of Music in Kraków. After graduating from the Academy, he became a teacher there and began his career as a composer in 1959 during the Warsaw Autumn festival. His Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima for string orchestra and the choral work St. Luke Passion have received popular acclaim. His first opera, The Devils of Loudun, was not immediately successful. Beginning in the mid-1970s, Penderecki's composing style changed, with his first violin concerto focusing on the semitone and the tritone. His choral work Polish Requiem was written in the 1980s and expanded in 1993 and 2005.</p>
